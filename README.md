# Boids Algorithm

A representation of boids algorithm using JavaScript and a graphical user interface

# Notes:

This script creates a canvas and populates it with 100 boids that move according to the rules of the boids algorithm. To implement the specific rules of the algorithm, you can add them to the update() method of the Boid class. For example, to implement the rule that boids try to move towards the center of mass of their neighbors, you could add the following code to the update() method
